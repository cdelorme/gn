Create a single-page webapp that pulls data from a web service (or services), renders some kind of visualization of the data (could just be text, it doesn't need to be an image or anything), and allows for at least one point of interaction with the data.

Some examples and ideas:

- An app that pulls down tweets from a Twitter search and allows the user basic retweet functionality
- An app to display a list of commits on a GitHub repo and allows the user to expand a commit, displaying all the impacted files
- A Google Maps app that loads your current location and displays nearby bars

The web service could be a public web service, or it could come from your own back-end, it's up to you. Think: simple. We are going to be evaluating your code quality, use of the language and tools. We'll give bonus points to unique or novel app ideas as well.
